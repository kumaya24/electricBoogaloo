Capacity: Incident with a release of high energy in the presence of a direct control where a
serious injury is not sustained.
Direct Control: A barrier that is specifically targeted to the high-energy source; effectively
mitigates exposure to the high-energy source when installed, verified, and used properly; and
is effective even if there is unintentional human error during work that is unrelated to the
installation of the control.
Energy Contact: Instance when high energy is transmitted to the human body.
Energy Proximity: A circumstance where a high-energy source may be within 6 feet of a
worker before being contained or any distance when there is restricted egress from the
energy source.
Energy Release: An instance where energy source changes state and is exposed to the
environment.
Exposure: Condition where high energy is present in the absence of a direct control.
High Energy: An element of work that involves more than 500 ft-lbs of physical energy.
High-Energy Incident: An instance where the high-energy source was released and where
the worker came in contact with or proximity to the high-energy source.
High-Energy Serious Injury or Fatality (HSIF): Incident with a release of high energy in the
absence of a direct control where a serious injury is sustained.
Low-Energy Serious Injury or Fatality (LSIF): Incident with a release of low energy in the
absence of a direct control where a serious injury is sustained.
Low Severity: Incident with a release of low energy where no serious injury is sustained.
Potential Serious Injury or Fatality (PSIF): Incident with a release of high energy in the
absence of a direct control where a serious injury is not sustained.
Serious Injury or Fatality: Life-threatening or life-altering incident as defined by the EEI SIF
Criteria.
Success: Condition where a high-energy incident does not occur because of the presence of
a direct control.
