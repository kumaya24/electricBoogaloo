High energy is present only if one or more of the following scenarios occur:

Suspended Load: More than five hundred lbs of load higher than one foot off the ground.

or

Elevation: A human at four or more feet above ground is high energy.

or

Mobile Equipment/Traffic With Workers on Foot:  Most mobile equipment, including motor vehicles, exceeds the high-energy threshold when the equipment or vehicle is in motion.

or

Motor Vehicle Incident (occupant): Estimates of the motor vehicle speed of thirty miles per hour or more is high energy.

or

Heavy Rotating Equipment: All heavy rotating equipment beyond powered hand tools typically exceed the high-energy threshold

or

High Temperature: Exposure to any substance greater than or equal to 150 degrees Fahrenheit

or

Steam: Any circumstance with the release of steam exceeds the high-energy threshold. 

or

Fire With Sustained Fuel Source: Fire with a sustained source of fuel exceeds the high-energy threshold. 

or

Explosion: Most incidents described as an explosion exceed the high-energy threshold. 

or

Excavation or Trench: An exposure to unsupported soil in a trench or excavation that exceeds five feet of height exceeds the high-energy threshold. 

or

Electrical Contact With Source: Electricity equal to or exceeding 50 volts 

or

Arc Flash: Any arc flash exceeds the high-energy threshold

or

High Dose of Toxic Chemical or Radiation: Exposure to toxic chemicals or radiation.

Only the above situations are high-energy scenarios.
